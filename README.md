var checkPointIn = require('check-point-in-rectangle');
checkPointIn(point, rectangle [,precision]) 
```
**point** array of x and y coordinates
**rectangle** array of four corner points
**precision** is used in algorithm to compare the area of rectangle and sum of triangles formed by point with rectangle, default is 6
### example
````javascript
var checkPoint = require('check-point-in-rectangle');
if (checkPoint([5,5],[[0,0], [10,0], [10,10], [0,10]]) == true) {
